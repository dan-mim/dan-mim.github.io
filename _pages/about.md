I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at Mines Paris ([CMA](https://www.cma.mines-paristech.fr/)) and IFP énergies nouvelles (Applied Mathematics Department), under the supervision of Paul Malisani, [Welington de Oliveira](https://www.oliveira.mat.br/) and Jiamin Zhu.

Through our objective of solving optimization problems under uncertainty in energy management, we explore, leverage, and enhance techniques in optimal transport, machine learning, convex optimization, and stochastic optimization algorithms.

I am dedicated to combining theoretical research in optimization with practical applications across industries, including energy, biomedical sciences, and technology-driven fields.
